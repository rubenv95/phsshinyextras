\usage{
primary_suppression(
  data,
  suppression_variable,
  no_secondary = FALSE,
  min_unsuppressed = 5,
  keep_original = TRUE
)

secondary_suppression(data, suppression_variable, .group_vars)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataset to suppress}

\item{suppression_variable}{A numeric/integer column to suppress}

\item{no_secondary}{TRUE means you don't need to apply secondary suppression}

\item{min_unsuppressed}{The minimum number that should not be suppressed
5 as a default (which means numbers between 1-4 will be suppressed)}

\item{keep_original}{TRUE or FALSE whether you would like a version of the
original column to check suppression has been applied correctly}

\item{...}{A list of variables to group the data by before suppressing
(see examples for usage)}
}
\description{
\code{primary_suppression()} and \code{secondary_suppression()} suppress values in
a column based on disclosure control principles.
}
\details{
\code{primary_suppression()} will apply primary suppression to a numeric or integer
column.
It is designed to be used in tandem with \code{secondary_suppression()} by default.
It converts values ready to be suppressed to -999 temporarily, which
get converted to an asterisk in the \code{secondary_suppression()} function.
To only use primary suppression, use \code{no_secondary = TRUE} as an input.
This will convert suppressed values to an asterisk in the first instance.

By default, the original column is retained for QA purposes and suppression
is applied to numbers between 1-4. There are inputs to change these defaults
\code{secondary_suppression()} is applied after primary suppression to data that
displays a total (such as having SIMD 1-5 and Total).

Secondary suppression ensures a suppressed value cannot be calculated when
only one value is suppressed. It does so by suppressing the next lowest value
when only one number is suppressed.
